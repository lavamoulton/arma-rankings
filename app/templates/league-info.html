      <h2>League rules</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      The goal of having leagues and rankings is for it to be fun and fair for everyone. To make this possible, some basic rules are required.
      <h3>The short version</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Show up on time.
        </li>
        <li>
          No late (re)joining.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t leave early.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t RQ; appeal to an admin if you get d/c’d.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t spam during matches. Don’t /shout from spec.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>The longer version</h3>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
            Show up for your match on time. The first match starts on the hour, the second usually 25-30 minutes after that, and so on. If you’re not there when it starts, you will not be allowed to play and that match will not be counted towards your ranking. Our primary match servers are named "Sumo Bar League (EU 1)" or "Sumo Bar League (US 1)".
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
            No rejoining. If you leave at any point for any reason, you will not be able to rejoin. This way, the possible situation where a player no longer cares about their own score only to start manipulating others’ scores is avoided. See Rule 4 about how leaving affects your rating.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
            Don’t leave early. The scores are recorded to logs once the “Match Winner:” center message appears. To be absolutely sure, please stay an extra 5 seconds (this also lets us take screenshots of the match scores.) If you leave before any scores have been recorded, you may be assigned a score of 0 for that match, so don’t risk it.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
            If you leave during the first 6 rounds, the match won’t count for you and you won’t be penalized. If you exit the server after the start of round 7, you’ll finish in last place in that match and thus your rating will take a hit. If you were genuinely disconnected for reasons beyond your control (internet issues, client crash, etc) you may appeal to an admin who will subjectively decide an outcome for you. If you’re not fully content with the verdict, kindly remember that the admin is taking the entire rating system into consideration; not just your personal convenience.
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-top: 5px;"> 
                Obvious rage quits will be penalized. Repeat offenders will be given bans of increasing length, starting with 1 full week.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
            If you’re not playing, keep shouting to a minimum. Please show respect to all players by letting them focus on the game for the duration of the match. We’re keeping the bar for silencing spectators who shout very low; if you feel bad about getting silenced easily, just move on with your life. Excessively complaining about it might just get you into further trouble. Trying to circumvent being silenced by rejoining might get you instantly silenced again as a precautionary measure, depending on the situation. There are no appeals for being silenced, just deal with it and move on.
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-top: 5px;">
                Even if you’re playing, please keep your chatting to a healthy minimum. Occasional messages and instant chats are fine, but as soon as it becomes disruptive to the other players you may be silenced without warning for any duration. If this happens, just finish your match and – if absolutely necessary – discuss the decision with an admin after the session. There are no appeals for being silenced, but you may be given an explanation. Since being silenced doesn’t prevent you from playing the game, leaving the server upon being silenced very much counts as a rage quit and you may be penalized for doing so.
